# Few-Shot-Image-CAPTCHA-Classifier
A few-shot approach to classifying image CAPTCHA's using deep learning and computer vision techniques. Specifically, a comparison between ResNet-16 (CNN) and ViT_B_16 (Transformer) in classifying CAPTCHA images within a few-shot approach.

Project was completed as part of the **20600 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision** module within the **MSc Data Science and Business Analytics** course at **Università Bocconi**
